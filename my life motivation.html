<p>Here are 3 that always make me think and get me to want to move to the next level</p>

<p>we all go trough situations that we wish had never happened to us, but once a wise man said i quote:"you don't grow in good times"</p>  

<img src="pic2.jpeg"width="480"height="800">
<p>This is reminds me that no doing it, is being selfish because whatever we were meant to do is useless if we never act upon and as a result, the all world will never see that thing the only us were gifted with.</p>

<p>This last one is favorite one, i used to be very reactive after being offended by a person but that changed after reading this.
<p>A wise man once said, "whoever controls your emotion or reaction controls you"

<p>Hope you learned something by reading this.
